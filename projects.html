            <h3>Lost and Found</h3>
            <p>It was 16”x16”painting, dark grey background, of a white woman with brown hair pulled up, facing right. It was also 2 inches thick. Her hair is pulled up in a grey shawl, and her shoulders are covered in a black shawl. Underneath it is an olive grey shawl. The woman is in her mid 30s looking.</p>

            <h3>Face Generator</h3>
            <p>I wrote the code for this alien face by analyzing and studying the example project code that the professor showed us. I found it challenging to maintain the proportion of the eyes and pupils according to movement.</p>

            <h3>Experimental Clock</h3>
            <p>The idea behind the 'End of Semester Clock' is to create a visual representation of the progress through the semester. The clock will track the time from August 26, 2024, to December 13, 2024, and display the progress as a percentage. The goal is for the clock to reach 100% on the final day of the semester, December 13. Rather than measuring time through traditional hours, minutes, and seconds, this clock will measure how much of the semester has passed in terms of days.</p>

            <h3>Exquisite Corpse</h3>
            <p>This Pineapple Gingerbread Man is a fascinating creature that can live in both tropical and cold climates. Its upper body stays warm, while its lower body remains cool, allowing it to roam around anywhere. People often catch and eat this Gingerbread Man, saying that it tastes like a delicacy fit for a king</p>

            <h2>Project 5</h2>
            <h3>Optical Illusion</h3>
            <p>For this project, I wanted to create a design that is simple yet effectively conveys an optical illusion in the most intuitive way. Therefore, I used perspective to make a 2D design appear 3D, giving the impression of a ball being sucked inward. I adjusted the size of the ball to enhance the illusion when it moves. It may look simple, but I believe this is the most “optical illusion-like” design that I can create while utilizing my strengths.</p>

            <h3>Data Portrait</h3>
            <p>I tracked how much water I drank throughout the week, depending on the day. My data portrait records the total amount of water I drank each day and presents it in a way that’s easy to understand using the number of glasses. For example, on Monday, 8 out of 12 glasses are filled, which means I drank 8 glasses of water that day. </p>

    <h3>Autobiographical Game</h3>
    <p>This game is a reflection of my life, from my school days in Korea to just before I came to the U.S. In Korea, I failed my first attempt at the college entrance exams, and my second attempt didn’t go as planned either. Yet, in a turn of fate, I was accepted into Parsons, an opportunity that brought me to New York — a life I could never have imagined during those earlier years.</p>
