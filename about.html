        <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <p>I enjoy watching motor racing, and I love spending my free time watching the Formula 1 Grand Prix. Among the F1 teams, I am a passionate tifosi, wholeheartedly supporting Scuderia Ferrari. I also love drawing and designing cars or motorcycles. Although it may not align with my current major, working in this field is my ultimate dream. I enjoy playing games as well, and watching esports matches of League of Legends teams is one of my hobbies.

            To connect these interests to my aspirations, I am studying coding and technology at school. Initially, I pursued this path because I simply enjoyed drawing and dreamed of becoming a designer. However, as I delved deeper into design and technology at school, I realized I had underestimated how complex and challenging this field truly is. Now, I am working hard to get closer to my dream by studying coding, technology, and design. I am trying to build various portfolios and gain diverse experiences to achieve my goals.</p>
